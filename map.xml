Welcome to this game.
This is version 0.6 of the map.

When it's ready, you will go for a trasure hidden in this country.
You'll have to find objects and use them and do everything you
have to do in the most classic of adventure games.

Presently supported Commands are:
quit (Q)
inventory (I)
go north/east/south/west (N/E/S/W)
look [at &lt;object&gt;] -- Look at location [or object]
take &lt;object&gt;
drop &lt;object&gt;
open &lt;object&gt; [with &lt;object&gt;]
use &lt;object&gt; [on/with &lt;object&gt;]
say &lt;words&gt;
give &lt;object&gt; to &lt;person&gt;
</variable>
